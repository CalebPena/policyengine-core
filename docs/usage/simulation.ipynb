    "# Simulating policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use-case of PolicyEngine Core country packages is to compute unknown variables for a given household, under a country's law. To do this, we need to specify the input household, using the entity and variable definitions as defined in the country code. If you're not sure what entities to declare or which variables to specify for which time periods, check the repository of the country package you're using. This page shows examples of how to use an existing country model to simulate policy.\n",

    "## Simulating on individual households\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating policy on individual households is simple: import `Simulation` from the country package, and pass in the household's data as a dictionary. Then, use `Simulation.calculate(variable_name, time_period)` to compute a particular variable at a particular time period. The input data should be a dictionary, under the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entity plural (e.g. \"people\")\n",
    "  * Entity ID (e.g. \"person\")\n",
    "    * Variable name (e.g. \"age\")\n",
    "      * Time period (e.g. \"2019-01\"). This is optional; providing a single value here will use the default time period.\n",
    "        * Value (e.g. 30)\n",
    "    * (Only for group entities) The plural of the *role* (e.g. \"members\").\n",
    "      * The list of entity IDs who meet that role\n",
    "\n",
    "```{eval-rst}\n",
    ".. hint::\n",
    "    You don't have to pass in group entity plurals if there's only one group entity (e.g. if everyone is a member of the same household). Just pass in the single entity key (e.g. \"household\").\n",
